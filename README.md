**Amazon Product Scraper** ðŸ›’  
This Python script scrapes product details (name, price, and rating) from Amazon India's "Smartphones" category using ScraperAPI to bypass bot detection. The data is saved into a CSV file (`amazon_products.csv`), and the raw HTML is stored for inspection (`page_source.html`). Logging is enabled to capture any errors during the scraping process.  

**Features:**  
- Uses ScraperAPI for JavaScript rendering and IP rotation.  
- Parses product data with BeautifulSoup.  
- Exports data to CSV for easy analysis.  
- Error logging for smooth debugging.
